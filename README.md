# Axis Aligned Rectangles: Visual PAC Learning Tool

The case of **axis aligned rectangles** is an educational touchstone for researchers describing and exploring the theoretical concepts behind **Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning**, a foundational framework in computational learning theory.

This interactive tool provides visualizations of practical examples to make abstract PAC learning principles more tangible and accessible. 

## Applications

- Sample size calulcator
- Boosting/bagging random hypotheses 


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jwhiteside11/axis-aligned-rectangles.git
cd axis-aligned-rectangles
```

Then start the app:

```bash
python gui_pac.py # sample complexity visualizer
# OR
python gui_adaboost.py # boosting/bagging visualizer
```
